    print("""The Imperium of Man, also called simply the Imperium, is a galaxy-spanning, interstellar human empire, the ultimate authority for the vast majority of the human species in the Milky Way galaxy in the 41st Millennium A.D.
It is ruled by the living god known as the Emperor of Mankind.

However, there are other humanoid species classified as Imperial citizens, mainly mutant offshoots of genetic baseline humans known as Abhumans, which include sub-species like Ogryns, Ratlings, and Squats.

The founder and ruler of the Imperium is the god-like Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful human psyker ever born.
He founded the Imperium over 10,000 Terran years ago in the late 30th Millennium during the Unification Wars on Old Earth, following the apocalyptic period in human history known as the Age of Strife.

The Emperor nominally continues to rule the Imperium as both its political master and primary religious figure. 
However, His badly damaged body is interred within the cybernetic life support mechanisms of the arcane device known as the Golden Throne, following His mortal wounding during the ancient interstellar civil war of the Horus Heresy.

Due to this fate, the Emperor is incapable of interacting on a day-to-day basis and has left the governance of the Imperium to the Senatorum Imperialis, an oligarchic ruling council of powerful noble lords and adepts in the galaxy. 
The Senatorum Imperialis is currently led by the Emperor's genetic son, Primarch Roboute Guilliman, who chairs the council and directs Imperial policy as the Lord Commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent.

The Imperium of Man is a war-torn stellar empire teetering on the brink of collapse. For 10,000 Terran years, 
it has been ruled by the deathless Emperor, a being of almost limitless psychic power, to whom thousands of souls are sacrificed daily to provide Him the psychic strength to maintain the Imperium's lines of communication and transport.

The peoples of the Imperium live in a galaxy where Daemons are real, mutation is frequent, and death is a constant companion. 
To be alive in the 41st Millennium is to know that the universe is a terrifying and hostile place. It is a place where you are but one among billions, and no matter how heroic your death, you will not be missed. 
A truly vast domain, the Imperium spreads among the many stars of the galaxy. Its territories encompass untold millions of stars and countless trillions of human lives.""")

    print("""Hades: The Swamp Planet of the Imperium

Hades is a bleak, swamp-covered world located in the far reaches of the galaxy, characterized by its dense fog, stagnant waters, and an oppressive atmosphere filled with toxic gases. 
This inhospitable environment has led to unique adaptations in both its inhabitants and the technology produced here.

Landscape and Environment:
- Swamp Terrain: Vast expanses of swamp are interspersed with murky lakes and treacherous marshlands, creating a challenging landscape for any who dare to traverse it.
The ground is often unstable, with hidden sinkholes and submerged vegetation lurking beneath the surface.
- Toxic Atmosphere: The atmosphere is rich in swamp gases, consisting of methane, sulfur, and other volatile compounds. This makes the air thick and difficult to breathe without proper filtration gear. 
The gases are also responsible for the planet's eerie glow, giving Hades a haunting appearance by night.

Mechanized Infantry Hub:
- Imperial Manufacturing: Hades serves as a crucial manufacturing hub for mechanized infantry. The Imperial Guard trains and equips its soldiers here, specializing in Armored Infantry units designed to navigate the challenging swamp environment.
- Unique Combat Vehicles: The mechanized infantry units utilize specially designed vehicles adapted for swamp terrain, featuring buoyant treads and enhanced mobility to traverse deep waters and thick mud.

Flamethrower Refinement:
- Gas Refining Operations: The swamp gases are harvested and refined in specialized facilities that process them into highly flammable fuels used to power advanced flamethrowers. 
This technology is essential both for the Imperial Guard and in defending Hades from external threats.
- Flamethrower Development: The complex engineering behind the flamethrowers gained notoriety due to their efficiency and lethality. Troops trained on Hades are adept at using these weapons to clear enemies and control the battlefield.

Strategic Importance:
- Defense and Warfare Training: Hades stands as a vital training ground, preparing soldiers to adapt to hostile environments and develop combat strategies tailored to swamp conditions. The horrors of war are ever-present here
, with endless training rounds and live-fire exercises honing the skills of the mechanized infantry.
- Defending the Imperium: Despite its desolate nature, the swamp planet is strategically important to the Imperium. Should Hades fall into enemy hands, the refined flamethrowers could turn the tide against Imperial forces across nearby worlds.

Conclusion:
Hades is not just a swamp planet but a resilient stronghold where brave souls train to serve the Imperium. Enhanced by the toxic gases that aid in refining advanced weaponry,
Hades stands as a testament to humanity's adaptability and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming odds.""")

- **Taller than 2"**: Climb when measuring distance.

### 3. Flying Movement
- Can move over enemy models using Normal Move, Advance, or Fall Back. 

### 4. Embark and Disembark
- **Embark**: Must end up within 3" of a friendly Transport. Cannot embark and disembark in the same phase.
- **Disembark**: Must be within 3" of the Transport, not within Engagement Range of enemies. Can act normally if disembarking before the Transport moves; otherwise, restricted actions apply.

### 5. Transport Rules
- When a Transport is destroyed, roll D6 for each embarked model:
  - 1: Model destroyed.
  - 1-3: Model destroyed if within 6".

### 6. Reinforcements
- Can deploy units from Reserves starting from Battle Round 2, ensuring strategic placement outside enemy territory.
- Any un-deployed units by the end of the battle are considered destroyed.

### 7. Strategic Reserves
- Limited to a maximum of 25% of total army points, excluding Fortifications.
